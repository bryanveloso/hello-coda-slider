# hello-coda-slider

This is my fork of [Niall Doherty's Coda Slider jQuery script](http://www.ndoherty.biz/demos/coda-slider/2.0/), modified for my use on Hello! Ranking.

The default script took me 95% of where I needed it to go, however, like many panel/carousel scripts, it assumed that all the "panels" were the same width. Since my "panels" were pictures of different widths, I modified it to correctly scroll through the different sized panels.

This is my first time hacking a jQuery plugin, so it only goes as far as I have needed it to. Feel free to fork and request a pull if you do any work on it. :)
